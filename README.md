Welcome to Flux a unique browsing experience. 
It's still in beta so don't switch to it fully just yet.
There is are little to no bugs in the browser currently. 
The Browser itself is only on MacOS for now. There are a few hidden tricks in the browser like ch/ for chatgpt results, flux/settings to get to settings, and flux/sketch to get to a sketching tool. The browser is running in a python framework that runs off chromium.
